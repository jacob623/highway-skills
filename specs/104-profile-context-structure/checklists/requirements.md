- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation passed on the first pass.
- Version stays 4.0.0 for the skill and 3.0.0 for the shared record because optional Context does not change the four readiness domains.
- The Experience section stays the current short citation. Restated interaction rules are removed from the behavior sections and are not copied into Experience.
- Highway Profile Intent Summary is updated only when that document is present. Brownfield Onboarding Idea is out of scope.
